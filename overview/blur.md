# blur()
## Q(selector).blur()
Triggers the blur event on the selected elements, which simulates the user clicking away from the element, typically used for form elements. This method can be used to programmatically remove focus from an element.
```
Q('input').blur();
```
The blur method is used to simulate the action of a user moving focus away from an input or other focusable element. It is often employed in scenarios where you want to trigger focus loss events programmatically, such as when validating form inputs or closing a custom dropdown menu when clicking outside. By invoking blur, you can ensure that focus behavior aligns with your applicationâ€™s needs without requiring user interaction.

One potential drawback is that the blur method may not always produce the same effects across different browsers or elements, especially in custom components or complex UI frameworks. Also, overusing blur to manipulate focus can lead to a less intuitive user experience if not handled carefully.

## Examples:
### Removing focus from an input field:

Programmatically blurs the focus from an input element, triggering any associated blur event handlers.
```
Q('input').blur();
```
This code will remove focus from the input field, which can be useful for validating or resetting the field when a form is submitted or an action is performed.

### Triggering blur on form fields after validation:

Forcing the blur event on all input fields after form submission to trigger validation or cleanup.
```
Q('form input').each(function() {
    Q(this).blur();
});
```
In this example, every input field within a form will be blurred, which could be used to trigger field validation or update UI elements based on field focus changes.

### Using blur to close a custom dropdown:
Simulating blur to close a dropdown menu when clicking outside.
```
Q(document).on('click', function(event) {
    if (!Q(event.target).closest('.dropdown').length) {
        Q('.dropdown').blur();
    }
});
```
This code ensures that if a user clicks outside of a dropdown menu, the dropdown will lose focus and potentially close. This approach helps manage the visibility of UI components in response to user interactions.
