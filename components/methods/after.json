  "Desc": "Inserts content after each element in the current set of matched elements.",
  "LongDesc": "The 'after' method allows you to insert content immediately following each element in the current set of matched elements. It accepts a variety of inputs, including strings for raw HTML, HTMLElements, Q objects, arrays of elements, or NodeLists. Strings are added as raw HTML, while elements and objects are inserted as siblings after the target nodes. Arrays and NodeLists are iterated over, inserting each element individually. This method is useful for dynamically adding content in a structured and predictable manner, enhancing the flexibility of DOM manipulation.",
