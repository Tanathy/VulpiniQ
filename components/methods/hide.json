    "Name": "hide",
    "Method": "Prototype",
    "Desc": "Hides each node, optionally with a fade-out effect over a specified duration.",
    "LongDesc": "The hide method provides a way to hide DOM elements with optional animation. When used without a duration parameter, it immediately sets the display property to 'none'. When provided with a duration in milliseconds, it creates a smooth fade-out effect by transitioning the opacity to 0 before hiding the element. This method is useful for creating more engaging user interfaces with subtle animations, and it supports a callback function that executes after the hiding operation completes.",
