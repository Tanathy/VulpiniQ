  "Name": "isExists",
  "Method": "Prototype",
  "Desc": "Checks if the first node exists in the DOM.",
  "LongDesc": "The isExists method provides a simple way to determine if an element is present in the current document. When called on a Q object, it checks if the first node in the collection exists within the DOM. As a static method, it accepts a selector string and verifies if any element matching that selector exists. This is particularly useful for conditional logic that depends on element presence before performing operations.",
  "Type": "Utilities",

    { "Script": "Q(selector).isExists();" },
    { "Script": "Q.isExists('.ok')" },
    { "Script": "if(Q('#myElement').isExists()) { /* do something */ }" }
