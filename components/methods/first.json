    "Desc": "Returns the first node.",
    "LongDesc": "The first method provides a convenient way to access the first element in a collection of nodes. This is particularly useful when you have multiple elements matching a selector but only need to work with the first occurrence. It returns a new Q instance containing only the first node, allowing you to chain additional methods on this specific element.",

    "Example": [
        "Q(selector).first();",
        "Q('li').first();",
