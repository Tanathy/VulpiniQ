  "Name": "each",
  "Method": "Prototype",
  "Desc": "Iterates over all nodes in the Q object and executes a callback on each node, providing access to the index and element. Chainable. Does nothing for empty selection.",
  "LongDesc": "The 'each' method is a utility for iterating over all elements in the Q object. It allows you to execute a callback function for each element, providing access to both the index and the element itself. The method is chainable and does nothing if the selection is empty. This is particularly useful for performing operations on each element in a collection, such as applying styles, adding event listeners, or extracting data.",
  "Type": "Iteration",
  "Example": [
    "Q(selector).each((index, element) => console.log(index, element)); // Log index and element",
    "Q('.items').each((i, el) => el.style.color = 'red'); // Set color",
    "Q('li').each((i, el) => el.textContent = `Item ${i+1}`).addClass('numbered'); // Chaining after each",
    "Q('.missing').each((i, el) => console.log(i, el)); // Does nothing for empty selection"
