  "Desc": "Appends child nodes, HTML, or multiple elements to each node.",
  "LongDesc": "The 'append' method allows you to add content to the end of each element in the current set of matched elements. It accepts a variety of inputs, including strings for raw HTML, HTMLElements, Q objects, arrays of elements, or NodeLists. Strings are added as raw HTML, while elements and objects are appended as child nodes. Arrays and NodeLists are iterated over, appending each element individually. This method is particularly useful for dynamically building or modifying the DOM, enabling seamless integration of new content into existing structures.",
