  "Name": "bind",
  "Method": "Prototype",
  "Desc": "Adds an event listener to each node, allowing for event delegation to improve performance.",
  "Long Desc": "The 'bind' method attaches an event listener to each element in the set of matched elements. It supports event delegation, which improves performance by allowing a single event listener to handle events for multiple child elements. This method is particularly useful for dynamic content where elements are added or removed frequently.",
  "Type": "Event Handling",
  "Example": [
    "Q(selector).bind(\"click\", () => console.log(\"Clicked\")); // Logs 'Clicked' when any matching node is clicked",
    "Q('.btn').bind(\"mouseover\", (e) => { console.log(`Hovered over: ${e.target.tagName}`); }); // Logs the tag name of the hovered element"
  ],
  "Variables": ["event", "handler"]
