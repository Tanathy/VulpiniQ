    "Name": "prev",
    "Method": "Prototype",
    "Desc": "Gets the previous sibling element of each node, optionally filtered by a selector.",
    "LongDesc": "Returns the immediate previous sibling element for each element in the set, with an optional filter to match specific elements. This traversal method provides a way to navigate to adjacent elements in the DOM that share the same parent. It's particularly useful for navigating through lists, steps in a process, or tabular data where you need to access the previous element in sequence, or for implementing keyboard navigation, pagination, or other reverse-directional UI components.",
    "Type": "Traversal",
    "Example": [
        "const previousElement = Q('#current').prev();",
        "Q('li.active').prev().addClass('completed');",
        "Q('.step-3').prev('.step').trigger('focus');",
        "const prevSlide = Q('.current-slide').prev('.slide');"
