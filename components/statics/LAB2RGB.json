  "Name": "LAB to RGB Converter",
  "Method": "Static",
  "Desc": "Converts LAB (Lightness, a*, b*) color values to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format.",
  "LongDesc": "The LAB2RGB utility transforms color representations from the LAB color space back to the RGB color space. The LAB color space is perceptually uniform and device-independent, with L representing lightness (0-100), a* representing the green-red axis (-128 to +127), and b* representing the blue-yellow axis (-128 to +127). This conversion allows for manipulating colors in the more intuitive and device-independent LAB space before converting them back to the device-dependent RGB space for display. The function implements a standard conversion algorithm that first converts LAB to XYZ and then XYZ to RGB, applying gamma correction to produce accurate sRGB values. This utility is essential for color management systems, image processing applications, and any situation where precise color manipulation across different devices is required.",

    "function adjustSaturation(r, g, b, factor) { const lab = Q.RGB2LAB(r, g, b); lab[1] = lab[1] * factor; lab[2] = lab[2] * factor; return Q.LAB2RGB(lab[0], lab[1], lab[2]); }"
