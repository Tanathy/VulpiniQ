  "Name": "RGB to LAB Converter",
  "Method": "Static",
  "Desc": "Converts RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values to LAB (Lightness, a*, b*) color space format.",
  "LongDesc": "The RGB2LAB utility transforms color representations from the RGB color space to the LAB color space. The LAB color space is designed to approximate human vision and is perceptually uniform, meaning that the same amount of numerical change corresponds to the same amount of visually perceived change. The L component represents lightness (0-100), the a* component represents the green-red axis (-128 to +127), and the b* component represents the blue-yellow axis (-128 to +127). Unlike RGB, the LAB color space is device-independent, making it valuable for accurate color matching across different devices. This utility is particularly useful for advanced color manipulation, image processing tasks, and applications requiring precise color control.",

    "const red = 255; const green = 0; const blue = 0; const labColor = Q.RGB2LAB(red, green, blue); console.log(`L: ${labColor[0].toFixed(2)}, a*: ${labColor[1].toFixed(2)}, b*: ${labColor[2].toFixed(2)}`);",
    "const color1 = Q.RGB2LAB(255, 100, 50); const color2 = Q.RGB2LAB(200, 150, 100); const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(color2[0] - color1[0], 2) + Math.pow(color2[1] - color1[1], 2) + Math.pow(color2[2] - color1[2], 2)); console.log(`Perceptual color distance: ${distance.toFixed(2)}`);"
